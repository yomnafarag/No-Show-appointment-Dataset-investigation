# No-Show-appointment-Dataset-investigation
This dataset, originally from Kaggle, collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up
for their appointment. A number of characteristics about the patient are included in each row.
I started my investigation with data wrangling including cleaning and assessing followed by analysis the data by brainstorming some questions I could find their answers in the dataset statistically
